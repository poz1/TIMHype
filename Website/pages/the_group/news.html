        <h1 class="content-title">Telecom Italia Group: Interim Report on Operations </h1>
        <p class="content-text">After the transposition into Italian law of the amendments to the Transparency Directive, the obligation already set out in art. 154-ter (Financial Reports) of Legislative Decree 58/1998 (Consolidated Law on Finance - CLF) to draw up Interim Reports on Operations for the first and third quarter of the year has been eliminated for Listed Issuers. However, the right to prescribe publication of periodic financial information in addition to the annual and half-yearly financial reports, through suitable regulations, and after having ascertained the impact, has been transferred to Consob.
    
        In this context, Telecom Italia confirms its intention of ensuring, on a voluntary basis and whilst awaiting legislative clarification, the continuity and regular supply of information to the market, publishing its usual information on the results as at 31 March 2016. It specifically reserves the right to duly assess the financial communication policy to be adopted by the Company, once the reference framework has been consolidated.</p>
